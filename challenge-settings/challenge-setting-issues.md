# Challenge Setting Issues

### Challenge setting p**rocess issues**

****

**High voter effort**

New funding categorisations in every funding round increases the effort and complexity for voters to participate. Voters needs to spend time reviewing all the challenges and take into account the focus areas and budget of each challenge and the most pressing needs of the ecosystem before they can make an informed decision. As the number of challenges increases there is increasing effort needed which decreases the number of voters who can participate due to the time requirements to vote. This could lead to increasing centralisation if an increasing number of voters are delegating their vote to another representative or simply not participating at all.

****

**High proposal assessor effort**

Constantly changing funding categorisations in each funding round results in a high effort required from proposal assessors to assess the challenges submitted each time and for those assessments to be reviewed. This uses up funding resources and time from assessors that could be spent assessing other idea or contributor based proposals.

****

**High governance complexity**

The challenge setting process results in suggesting new funding categorisations every funding round with different focus areas and budget weighting. This results in a recurring and complex governance decision for the community. The community needs to be well informed on the needs of the ecosystem to make well informed decisions on which categorisations to include and exclude. This is even more important when those decisions could mean preventing certain ideas from being able to submit proposals. The communities confidence would need to be higher to know that the excluded focus areas would not have proposals submitted that were more impactful than the ones that could be submitted.

****

**Expensive process due to incentives used for challenge teams, assessments and voting**

Challenge setting is an expensive process as it requires incentivised input from challenge team proposers, proposal assessors, veteran proposal assessors and voters in every single funding round. These stakeholders also need to have an understanding of the wider ecosystem to make important categorisation decisions.

****

**Challenging to scale an increasing number of challenges**

Challenge settings become more complex as they scale as if the community size increases it will likely lead to an increasing amount of challenge proposals, assessments and time needed for voters to assess and vote on those challenges. A larger amount of challenges increases the complexity of deciding between challenges making it a time and resource expensive process to scale. When coupled with an increasing amount of idea based proposals the funding process becomes increasingly complex and time consuming for the average voter to participate.



**High proposer effort**

Proposers in every funding round have to read the challenge settings that were selected to work out whether they can submit proposals. Constantly changing funding categorisations means this effort is needed every funding round. If a funding round is exclusionary to certain ideas then the proposer must interpret whether they can or can't submit certain ideas. If the categorisations are overlapping then the proposer must spend time comparing challenges to determine where best to submit their proposal.
