# Use Cases & Types Of Proposer

## Use cases



**Small ideas & initiatives**

Small initiatives cover things that people do in the community that help provide impact for the ecosystem. Some examples of small initiatives could be small community events, a new application or tool, translation of documents or reports or minor updates and improvements to available tools, infrastructure or standards. Small ideas & initiatives below the cost of $5,000 in value are less suited for a community wide vote as the cost of the aggregated time for voters to decide on these initiatives can easily scale beyond the value of the initiatives they are voting on. Due to this there will be a need for a faster funding process to support the smaller but still valuable idea and initiatives in the ecosystem.



**Small experiments**

Small experiments would aim to cover any novel new ideas or areas that benefit from research, analysis, implementations or collaborations so the ecosystem can learn something new. They could be focussed on many areas like community collaboration, governance, infrastructure, application development and more.



**Early stage ideas**

Some larger ideas will benefit from breaking apart some of the initial work to research the idea further or to showcase the value to the community to secure a larger amount of funding in the future. Executing the early parts of an idea can be an effective way for individuals or teams to build up some initial reputation in the community by delivering on a smaller initial part of the idea.



## Types of proposers



**Newcomers to funding process**

People in the community who are now looking to start using the funding process to submit their ideas. These newcomers to the process could be looking for a less competitive way to start trying out new ideas in the ecosystem and would benefit from a category that makes it easier for them to get some initial funding. A category that helps newcomers can help with them building a reputation in the community.



**Non funded individuals and teams**

Active individuals and teams already participating in the community that have tried to receive funding already but so far have not been funded. These proposers could benefit from categorisations that make it easier for them to get some initial funding for the ideas they are working on. Executing smaller scoped proposals could help these individuals or teams get more exposure when the projects are completed and can be shared with the wider community. Some of the individuals or teams may be less well known in the community which could be a contributing factor for why they have no received funding so far.



**Funded community members**

Funded community members are anyone that has already been funded previously. These community members may or may not be more well known in the community. Funded community members would benefit from a category by being able to submit small ideas and experiments when they see opportunity to work on something that they believe will produce impact for the ecosystem. Funded community members will have insights based on their experience in the ecosystem that can translate to thinking of a range of small ideas, initiatives and experiments for the community to consider.
